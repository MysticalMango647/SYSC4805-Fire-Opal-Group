Presented to you by Fire Opal, a team of fourth year engineers at Carleton University. The following is a project proposal that will go over the details of the build process of a snow removal robot made on CoppeliaSim.

The Objective of this project is to build a robot that efficiently clears snow off of the given highlighted path while tackling multiple challenges faced on the path using Coppeliasim. 

To View the Robot Model, open snowplow.ttt

SYSCBot.ttm contains the model file for the robot

The code for the robot is stored in SnowPlowCode.py

To run simulation: please run the coppeiliaSim Code first, then run python after, otherwise it will timeout. The files in the main directory contain the support api files for windows only.

To test our robot in different maps, the folder "Robot on Training Maps" contains Fire Opal Robot on different maps provided from the class
